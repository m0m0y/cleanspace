					<h4> OUR VISION </h4>
					<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 pt4">
						<p> CleanSpace Technology was established in 2009 when a world class medical device engineering team saw a need to create a respirator that not only delivered the highest level of protection but was also comfortable and easy to use.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 pt4">
						<p> The respirator industry had not seen notable innovation in some 20 years, so when CleanSpace launched their first product a year later, it was seen as a game changer. CleanSpace Respirators are unique in that they provide all the protection of a conventional PAPR, but have no belts or hoses, do not create heat stress or fogging of eyewear, and are lightweight and simple to use.</p>
