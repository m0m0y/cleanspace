                    <h5>CleanSpace Products are covered by a limited warranty.</h5>
                    <p>To report a fault with a CleanSpace product please complete our Warranty Returns form and a CleanSpace customer service representative will contact you.</p>
                    <h5>CleanSpace Warranty Policy</h5>
                    <p>The CleanSpace Technology Pty Ltd warranty covers defects in materials and workmanship during the warranty period in every CleanSpace product you purchase, provided that the products has been used, cleaned and maintained in accordance with the CleanSpace instructions and CleanSpace’s recommendations.</p>
                    <p>The Company has the right to reject any Warranty claim made by a Purchaser pursuant to this Warranty where the Purchaser is unable to verify that the claim is made within the warranty period by providing proof of purchase documentation for the Product from an authorised distributor or reseller of CleanSpace, which clearly shows the date and place of purchase.</p>
                    <p>CleanSpace’s warranty period commences from the date of purchase as determined by the date on the packing slip or invoice. This warranty does not include consumable parts, such as filters and face masks, which must be replaced regularly by the user. Consumable parts are warranted up to the point of use, provided they have been stored correctly and are within their expiry date. CleanSpace may change the availability of limited warranties, at our discretion, but any changes we make will not be applied retrospectively. Please note that we do not provide warranty coverage for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><i class="bi bi-check"></i> Problems that result from external causes such as accident, abuse or misuse</li>
                        <li><i class="bi bi-check"></i> Usage that is not in accordance with the CleanSpace product instructions</li>
                        <li><i class="bi bi-check"></i> Products with missing or altered serial numbers</li>
                        <li><i class="bi bi-check"></i> Products which have had their housings opened or otherwise tampered with</li>
                        <li><i class="bi bi-check"></i> Problems caused by using third party accessories, parts or components</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>CleanSpace Technology Pty Ltd does not warrant that its products will operate without interruption or will be error-free, or that all errors may be corrected. CleanSpace’s sole liability and your sole remedy, for breach of the limited warranty will be repair or replacement of the product, at CleanSpace’s option, or if neither of the foregoing are reasonably available, a refund of the amount you paid less amounts attributed to your prior use.</p>
                    <p>
                    <p>Except as expressly set forth in the license agreement, CleanSpace makes no warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to its products. CleanSpace and its suppliers hereby specifically disclaim all other express, statutory and implied warranties and conditions, including the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and the implied condition of satisfactory quality.</p>
                    <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow a limitation on implied warranties, and so the foregoing disclaimer may not apply to you. In any event, any implied warranties that may exist under the laws of your jurisdiction are limited to the year period, specified in the user manual under product warranty, set forth in this limited warranty. </p>
                    <p>Any claim under this limited warranty must be made by contacting CleanSpace by phone or in writing by mail or email to the address below within the warranty period, specified in the user manual, from the date of purchase of the product. You must provide proof of purchase verifying that the claim is made within the warranty period. If CleanSpace requests, you must ship the allegedly defective product freight pre-paid to the address provided to you by the CleanSpace claim representative.</p>
